# L2-Net-Python-Keras
L2-Net patch descriptor ported to Python using Keras

This is a Keras implementation of the L2-Net patch descriptor described in 

Y. Tian, B. Fan, F. Wu. "L2-Net: Deep Learning of Discriminative Patch Descriptor in Euclidean Space", CVPR, 2017.

with weights from 

https://github.com/yuruntian/L2-Net

Requires keras, numpy, pickle and cv2

To get started use the function cal_L2Net_des in L2_Net.py which roughly corresponds to the similarly named function in https://github.com/yuruntian/L2-Net/matlab/cal_L2Net_des.m
